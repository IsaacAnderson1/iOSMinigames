# Blackjack App

## Overview

This Blackjack app is a simple app designed to simulate a basic game of Blackjack. Built using SwiftUI for the UI design and basic Swift for the logic element. 

## Features 

- **Simple Blackjack Logic**: Uses basic Blackjack rules(21=Blackjack, dealer plays card to self until 17+, etc, 22+ = bust, etc.)
- **Simple Interface**: A user-friendly interface as all buttons are clearly labeled and all within one screen.
- **Automatic Card Management**: Each card is randomized with cards Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., Queen, and King all having the same chance of appearing.
